# Request for Comments (RFC) Group Signup

## What is this?

The Request for Comments (RFC) group is a way that you can help us make games by providing feedback on certain key issues and topics we need more outsider input on. From concepts and features to super-early-access builds of our games, you can directly contribute to our games whilst getting a sneak peek at what we're working on.

## How do I sign up?

Just go to a project that has an RFC group and look for an issue named "RFC Group Signup" and comment on it with your GitLab account.

For convenience, here's a list of projects we have RFC groups for:

- [Unnamed Horror Game](https://gitlab.com/blue-bean-games/unnamed-horror-game/-/issues/9)
